# About Project
The goal of the project was to build a CLI quiz. Where I would read a CSV file and get Questions and Answer from it. Then I would generate the Questions and the user would answer the question. At the end it would tell you how many you got right and how many you got wrong

# Goals
- Learn to read from a CSV file
- Learn to understand the syntax of Golang
- Learn little bit about channels
- Learn to use package like time, encoding/csv, fmt, flags, etc
